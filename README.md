## About

  

The 'Digital India' mission of Indian Government is still a far-fetched dream for hinterland because people living in rural and remote parts of the country are still facing issues with internet accessibility and during the pandemic the scene has got more worse as network operators are diverting the bandwidth supply to meet the needs of urban people who are working from home.

  

Globally, you need an internet connection to get latest report about the Covid19 pandemic, hence countries like India with no steady access to Internet connection has no means of getting steady updates.

<br>

I've come up with a solution to breach this gap by integrating Twilio API to help people get latest info needed about the pandemic without having to be online.

  

### How it works

You'll only need to access the web application once, after which you'll get a pop-up asking for your mobile number.

And that's it, you'll be updated with covid report everyday.

(This process is automated using Cron job).

<br>

> Optionally, visiting the web app will automatically detect your location and help you get reported cases in your country + global cases only, so as not to bore you with big statistics data's.

<br>

The app also supports performing self test right on your device
